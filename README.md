# yuri
A web scrapper that sends me emails from a devotional website when there is internet or wait for connectivity

Yuri first checks if there is an email sent that day and returns if there is.
THe checks if there is internet access on my computer.
Using a different goroutine, Yuri scraps a devotional website which forms my email.
